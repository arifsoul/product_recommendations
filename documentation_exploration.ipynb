    "# Product Recommendation System Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script implements a simple product recommendation system using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It utilizes customer interactions data, product details, and purchase history to recommend products to users based on their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "This script relies on the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that these libraries are installed before running the script. You can install them using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas scikit-learn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Data**: The script loads three CSV files containing customer interactions, product details, and purchase history.\n",
    "2. **Merge Data**: It merges the three datasets based on common identifiers.\n",
    "3. **Preprocessing**: Features and target variables are selected, and data is normalized using Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "4. **Split Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.\n",
    "5. **Train Model**: A KNN classifier with k=3 neighbors is trained on the training data.\n",
    "6. **Evaluate Model**: The model's accuracy is evaluated on the testing data.\n",
    "7. **Recommendation Function**: A function is defined to recommend products for a given customer ID.\n",
    "8. **Example Recommendation**: An example recommendation is provided for a specific customer ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `recommend_products(customer_id)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes a customer ID as input and recommends products for that customer based on their behavior. It utilizes the trained KNN model to predict the product category of interest for the customer and recommends products from that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `customer_id`: The ID of the customer for whom recommendations are requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returns**:\n",
    "  - `recommended_products`: An array containing the recommended product IDs for the specified customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example recommendation for customer ID 5\n",
    "recommended_products = recommend_products(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation provides an overview of the functionality, usage, and functions present in the script. It serves as a guide for understanding and utilizing the product recommendation system implemented in the code."
